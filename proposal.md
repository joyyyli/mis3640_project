## MIS3640 Term Project Proposal

### 1. The Big Idea: What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you generate? What is your minimum viable product? What is a stretch goal?

Our **main idea** is to offer an alternative for people with decidophobia to find out what they want to eat every day. 

Our **minimum viable product** will be to create a website that offers customers customized recommendations about restaurants around their areas. The customers can choose (or not choose) the type of restaurants they are interested in, and then our website can randomly pick one restaurant for them. Additionally, we would also want to create a function to randomly decide a restaurant and dishes for the customer. This could be a fun interactive challenge between our customers and increase engagement.

Our **stretch goal** is to generate a community for restaurants to share their daily/monthly special recipes, and for customers to customize their preferences. The website will also collect data to track the preferences of customers for types of restaurants and specific restaurants. With more data on customers we can customize based on their preferences.

### 2. Learning Goals: Since this is a team project, you may want to articulate both shared and individual learning goals.
    
**Individual goal:**

Joy: I want to see what the final presentation of coding a project looks like. I would like to see how to integrate the coding with the visual appeal that the customer will see.

Vivian: By the end of this semester, I hope I can be proficient in python coding. In addition, I want to go through the process of building a website, from the backend to the frontend.

Ziyu: What I want to accomplish in this project is to use the python to run a whole project that can have a practical impact on our daily lives, which can not only benefit our teammates by helping us to use the python language more proficiently but also offer others a way to fix their problems. 
    
**The shared learning goal for the team:**

In addition to the coding itself, we would also like to learn more about project management of a large coding project like this. We would like to improve our teamwork by working through our different opinions as well as maximizing each person’s specialty. We want to learn how to utilize GitHub and other resources to help us work together as a team to complete the project.

### 3. Implementation Plan: this will probably be pretty vague initially. Perhaps at this early juncture you will have identified a library or a framework that you think will be useful for your project. If you don't have any idea how you will implement your project, provide a rough plan for how you will determine this information.

We will use Yelp app as a reference for the address and the type of restaurants. Use Horn Library a-z database to get a list of all businesses registered in a city and then filter to only include restaurants in that city. 

### 4. Project schedule: You have 8 weeks (roughly) to finish the project. Sketch out a rough schedule for completing the project. Depending on your project, you may be able to do this in great specificity or you may only be able to give a broad outline. Additionally, longer projects come with increased uncertainty, and this schedule will likely need to be refined along the way.

**Week 1:** Collect restaurants’ data (location, tel-number, recommended dish)
**Week 2:** Clean all the data and document into the dataset
**Week 3:** Start to build the function for customers to customize their preference
**Week 4:** Continue to build the function for customers to customize their preference
**Week 5:** Build another function for customers to rank the restaurants they have visited
**Week 6:** Start to build a draft website and build in the function
**Week 7:** Ask for feedback and improve for better UI and UX
**Week 8:** If have time, we will build another function for restaurants to update their recommended dishes, and create a community that customers can upload their recommendations 

### 5. Collaboration plan: How do you plan to collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you split tasks up, complete them independently, and then integrate? Will you pair program the entire thing? Make sure to articulate your plan for successfully working together as a team. This might also include information about any software development methodologies you plan to use (e.g. agile development). Make sure to make clear why you are choosing this particular organizational structure.

We are considering using the Agile development cycle during the whole process. We plan to meet every Monday morning to discuss our plan for the week. Then we will consider everyone’s schedule and assign the job accordingly. We will also have a follow-up meeting on Thursdays to check if everyone has finished their job. In addition, we can review and test everyone’s work, give some feedback, and fix the problems. 

Generally, Ziyu will work in the front end, be responsible for the UI and UX part of the project. Joy will be responsible for both the text part and also take charge of our datasets. Vivian will work in the back end and focus more on the codings. 

Since we are in three different time zones, it is hard for us to gather together and work on the same project. So we try to find ways to have everyone lead her own work and also have the opportunity to communicate with each other and make sure everyone is on the same page.

### 6. Risks: What do you view as the biggest risks to the success of this project?

* Hard to find an appropriate database. If we have to do this manually, it will be too time-consuming.
* We might not have enough time to fully accomplish our goal.
* How to collect user data and clean their data with so little time to actually collect the data 

### 7. Additional Course Content: What are some topics that we might cover in class that you think would be especially helpful for your project?

* How to install data into the python program
* How to create a website and how to improve the user interface in the python program
